## What I did
* Wrote programs running on ODROID-XU4 to control a Kobuki  (TurtleBot2) automatically track user-selected objects.
* Led a team of two inexperienced programmers. Properly assigned tasks based on their ability and skills. Designed interfaces between modules implemented by different programmers. Prepared plan-B's in case the team members fail to contribute usable programs on time.
* Wrote a Java wrapper for kobuki C++ libraries (for only the functions that we needed)
* Skills used: Java, socket, OpenCV, Multithreading, team/project management.
